This repository is used if the tutorial for "squashing git commits".
The tutorial is at, https://medium.com/@rhea49rdgs/squash-multiple-commits-into-a-single-commit-in-git-b4b0be326249.

This tutorial was created out of a desire to document the method of squashing commits in git.
I am fortunate that a colleague at my past internship showed me this, and I wanted to share it with everyone out there.

Feel free to fork this repo to get a hold of how git squash works using the tutorial.
